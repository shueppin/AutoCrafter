# AutoCrafter

This is a minecraft datapack to create a block, which automatically crafts certain items.
The item that should be crafted can be inserted in a simple GUI. the ingredients for the item can be put into the autocrafter block using a hopper. The output item can   be taken out of the autocrafter using a hopper or a hopper minecart

At the moment it isn't possible to craft every item. More items will be added somewhen. And it is possible to add your own crafting recipes.
